# Mo'orea Slope and Satellite Imagery Map #

The Mapbox style applied in this map was created to emphasize higher slope regions of the French Polynesian island of Mo'orea while simultaneously viewing the local satellite imagery (provided by DigitalGlobe) below a semi-transparent contour map. As a user zooms in at a progressively finer level of detail, the contour map becomes more opaque, until the satellite imagery is no longer visible. At a scale of 14, the satellite imagery gives way to a basic landuse map of the island, emphasizing population centers across the island.

The purpose of the this sequence of satellite imagery, then contours, then landuse map as the user zooms in progressively closer to the island, is intended to permit the user to explore potential links between areas of higher slopes and soil disturbances (structures or buildings, urbanized areas, roads, etc.), and vegetation type and coverage. Contour fills were symbolized using a bold green, allowing differentiation from vegetation in the satellite imagery below without unnecessary visual distraction, while contour lines have a fine line weight but a contrasting (orange-brown) color in order to provide a subtle guide to slope gradation. Town name labels, roads, and buildings, have more highly contrasting colors and symbology not only to draw the eye to elements of interest to the map, but also to allow easier differentiation of smaller, potentially easier to overlook features.
